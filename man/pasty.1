.SH "DESCRIPTION"
pasty is a simple commandline tool for pasting specific columns 
from an arbitrary number of column centric ASCII input files into 
a single output file. pasty currently expects the columns in the
input files to be separated by spaces (one or more).

.SH "OPTIONS"
pasty currently only supports a single optional specifier, indicating
what columns to extract from each of the input files. Without the
specifier, pasty will paste complete rows for each file and the
output is then identical to coreutil's paste command.

\fI-c COLUMN_SPEC

\fI--colspecs COLUMN_SPEC\fR


Extract the columns specified in COLUMN_SPEC for each file provided
on the command line. COLUMN_SPEC is a colon separated list of 
FILE_SPECs. FILE_SPEC is a comma separated list of zero based column
indices to be extracted for each input file and pasted into the output
file. Column indices larger than the number of columns are ignored and
the number of FILE_SPEC elements can be smaller than the total number 
of input files. In this case, the last FILE_SPEC provided is used for 
all remaining files. Without COLUMN_SPEC, all columns are pasted
for each input file.

\fI-u SEPARATOR

\fI--outsep SEPARATOR


Change the separator string between the columns in the output from 
the default single space to the string given in SEPARATOR STRING.
NOTE: In order to avoid that the shell interprets certain characters,
the string might need to be quoted.Quoting is also necessary when
SEPARATOR consists of or contains whitespace characters.
