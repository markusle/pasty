DESCRIPTION:

pasty is a command line utility written in Haskell for pasting from 
column centric plain text files. In its most basic mode, pasty 
is similar to the paste command which is part of coreutils. However, 
in contrast to paste, pasty can select an arbitrary collection of
columns from a list of files and paste them into an output file. 

Please consult the pasty man page for more details.
