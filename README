DESCRIPTION:

pasty is a command line utility written in Haskell for pasting column 
centric ASCII files. In its most basic mode, pasty is similar to 
the paste command that is part of coreutils. However, in contrast
to paste, pasty can pick any collection of (per file) columns from
an arbitrary (depending on your system limits, of course) number
of files and assemble them into a "pasted" final file.

Please consult the pasty man page for details.
